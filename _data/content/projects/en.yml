        ## 1. Motivation
        I always wanted to make my own homepage. <br/>
        I tried to make it using react and node.js, but it took a long time to learn design and coding. <br/>
        Therefore, while looking for a simple way to make it, I learned how to create a blog with github. <br/>
        
        ***
        ### 2. Start github blog
        1. Start with [github_blog_create](https://velog.io/@shg4821/%EA%B9%83%ED%97%88%EB%B8%8C-%EB%B8%94%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8-%EB%A7%8C%EB%93%A4%EA%B8%B0-1)
        1. Choose one from [Jekyll theme](https://jamstackthemes.dev/ssg/jekyll/)
        1. check [README](https://github.com/junsusong98/junsusong98.github.io/blob/main/README.md#readme)--> check Github pages
        1. Import it to 'local' using git clone, modify code using VScode, and `git push`
          - After that, add, commit, and push are repeated to continue pushing.;;
          - Check the **local build** of README.
          - But I may not know what you mean...

        ***
        ### 3. Local build detailed method
        1. Install ruby [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) <br/>
        2. Go from Ruby 'start command'. <br/>
        ![Image](:ruby.png) <br/>
        3. Enter `gem install bundler jekyll` after going to code address imported to 'local' via cd <br/>
        ![Image](:ruby2.png) <br/>
        ![Image](:ruby3.png) <br/>
        4. Enter `bundle exec jekyll serve` after installation is completed <br/>
        ![Image](:ruby4.png) <br/>
        5. Enter **http://localhost:4000/** in Chrome after loading!! <br/>
        Then, you can see that it's floating well

        ## 1. Motivation
        Paper : [IGZO channel ferroelectric memory FET](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9224469) (Masaharu Kobayashi ,1-4 Sept. 2020) <br/>
        An experiment was conducted to confirm the ferroelectric phenomenon in ITZO rather than IGZO by adding HZO based on the paper. <br/>
        To that end, it is important to plan the manufacturing process of FeFET well, and we made the mask necessary for the photolithography process. <br/>

        ***
        ## 2. Introduction of team members
        - [Taewon Jin](https://yh2424.github.io/people/taewonjin/)
        - [Teahyeon Noh](https://yh2424.github.io/people/NTH/)

        ***
        ## 3. Progress
        **Please understand that there is a private part of the lab that is covered.** <br/>
        ![Image](:FeFET2.png) <br/>
        In the process, it is necessary to check how it is deposited on the Si substrate. <br/>
        Therefore, we check the deposition process while making it using the shape of the ppt. <br/>
        ![Image](:FeFET4.png) <br/>
        It was also necessary to identify which process was required for each step. <br/>
        If the mask is not checked several times, the position of the Mask may change. <br/>
        I may have to wait for the Mask production again, so we need to check carefully. <br/>
        ![Image](:FeFET3.png) <br/>
        I made a Mask using Klayout and check the ppt to see if there is any problem. <br/>
        ![Image](:FeFET5.png) <br/>
        Steps to request the manufacture of the Mask to the company <br/>

        ***
        ## 4. Result
        All were completed without re-deposition and the ferroelectic phenomenon was confirmed. <br/>
        However, the performance was lower than that of IGZO. <br/>

        In addition, I have defined codes that make other shapes such as align mark and name. <br/>
        If you need it or want to use it, please send me an email. <br/>
        I will explain in detail with my example code. <br/>

        ## 1. Motivation
        ITZO (In-Sn-Zn-O) has higher mobility than IGZO. <br/>
        In addition, an efficient orbital overlapping chip phenomenon occurs in the 5s orbital of n3+ and Sn4+, making it easy to move electrons. <br/>
        Annelling has an effect on ITZO in the process. <br/>
        - The annealing process increases the electrical properties and stability of the TFT thin film. It also increases oxygen vacancy removal, M-O bond formation, and charge carrier generation.
        - Oxygen in the chamber is diffused into the empty space of the channel to reduce the empty space of oxygen and increase the interface trap between a-ITZO/SiO2.
        Thus, **I will grasp the characteristics of ITZO according to Annelling.**
        `Conditions`
        - Hot plate (AS, 150°C, 200°C, 250°C) [1 hour]
        - RTA (AS, 200°C, 300°C, 400°C, 500°C) [30 second]

          ## 1. Motivation
          The voltage-current relationship of TFT(Thin File Transistor) is as follows. <br/>
          ![Image](:TFT_VI2.png){: width="200" height="200"} <br/>
          ![Image](:TFT_VI3.png){: width="200" height="200"} <br/>
          Therefore, an experiment was conducted to check whether the properties of TFTs change according to changes in W and L. <br/>

        ##  1. What is TCAD Sentaurus?
        Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) refers to using computer simulations to develop and optimize semiconductor processing technologies and devices.  <br/>
        TCAD simulation tools solve fundamental, physical, partial differential equations, such as diffusion and transport equations for discretized geometries, representing the silicon wafer or the layer system in a semiconductor device.  <br/>
        This deep physical approach gives TCAD simulation predictive accuracy. <br/>
        Therefore, it is possible to substitute TCAD computer simulations for costly and time-consuming test wafer runs when developing and characterizing a new semiconductor device or technology. <br/>

        ## 1. Motivation
        The start-up club was started under the guidance of [Professor Kim Young-hyun](https://yh2424.github.io/people/younghyunkim/). <br/>
        Until February, the team members steadily presented their ideas once a week and selected the best start-up idea among them. <br/>
        After that, I presented my idea to Hanyang University's [start-up education center](https://eec.hanyang.ac.kr/circles/clubView/124) and I was able to receive support as a start-up club. <br/>
        I decided to participate in the contest and get the team's ideas evaluated. <br/>
